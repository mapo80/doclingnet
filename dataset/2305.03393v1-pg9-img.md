Optimized Table Tokenization for Table Structure Recognition

[Page-header]

order to compute the 'LED score: Interence timing results for all experiments were obtained hrom the same machine O= a Single core wich AMD BPYC 7763 CPU @2.45 GHz.

5.1 Hyper Parameter Optimization

We have chosen the Yub LabNet data set to pertorm HPO , since it includes a highly diverse set of tables. Also we report LED scores separately IOr Simple and It is complex tables (tables with cell spans). Results are presented in Table evident that with O2SL, our muodel achieves the same TED score and slightly better mAP scores in comparison to HTML, However OZISL yields & 2 speed up in the inference runtime over HTML.

Ef: Fects of reducing the # of layers in encoder and decoder stages of the model show that smaller  models trained on OTSL perform better; especially in  recognizing complex table structures, and maintain & much higher mAP score than Uhe HITML counterpart;
